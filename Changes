Edit This Page version history

30 October 2001
ETP code changed to support Oracle and OpenACS function style. No new
functionallity has been added. 
NOTE that prior versions are guaranteed to break if you update.

24 September 2001
ETP code checked in to the anonymous CVS server at openacs.org, and tagged
as version 1.01.  We changed the package internal name from editthispage 
to edit-this-page, which is more standard.  Unfortunately, the design of 
the APM tables prevents you from changing the package name in an existing 
database, so you'll need to reinstall the package and recreate any content 
items you may have.

30 August 2001
Version 1.0 released at http://etp.museatech.net/download/editthispage-1.0.apm.
