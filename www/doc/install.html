<hr>

I'm assuming you've already installed OpenACS 4, loaded
the data model, and you can see the "Congratulations!" page in your web browser.
 First, install the ETP package by navigating to the package manager (found at <code>acs-admin/apm</code>), and selecting "Load a new package from a URL or local directory".  
<p>
The Package Manager will retrieve the package code, place it in your server's 
<code>packages/editthispage</code> directory, and perform the necessary database
setup.  When that's done, you'll need to restart your server to load all
of the package's tcl code.</p><p>
Now you may test the package by visiting the Site Map (found at <code>admin/site-map</code>),
creating a new directory, selecting "new application", and choosing Edit
This Page.  Within that directory, anyone who has "write" permission will
see a link that takes them to the ETP interface from which they may edit the content of the page.
</p><p>However, you're not really having fun until you can modify your home
page through your web browser.  By entering the following commands, you'll
set up your site so that Edit This Page can also serve pages at the top level
of the URL hierarchy, including your home page.  Doing this will not prevent
access to the top-level admin pages; the acs-subsite package remains mounted
at the top level.</p><blockquote><pre>cd /web/MYSERVER/www
mkdir index-backup
mv index* index-backup
ln -s ../packages/edittthispage/www/index.vuh .
</pre></blockquote>
